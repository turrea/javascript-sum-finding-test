# javascript-test1
I was given the following instructions for a Javascript programming test over email:

In javascript: Write a function that, given an array of integers (x), and an integer (y), returns true if any two of the integers in x add up to y. (Optional) Now, write a function that, given the above arguments and an additional integer (z), returns true if any z of the integers in x add up to y.
